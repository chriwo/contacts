Feature: #78 - Add Sorting for Result List
==========================================

See :issue:`78`

Description
===========

To allow sorting of the results if the proximity search does not work because no postal code was entered,
a sorting of the list can be specified in the plugin configuration. Theoretically this can be extended for
a customer project. Currently the sorting by the title of the address or the distance is available.
